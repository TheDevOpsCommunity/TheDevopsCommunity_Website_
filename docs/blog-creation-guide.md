  ‚ùå "docker guide" (too short)
  ‚ùå "The Ultimate Complete Comprehensive Advanced Guide to Everything About Docker Containerization" (too long)
```

### 2. Slug Generation
```
- Convert title to lowercase

- Remove special characters
- Keep only letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Max 60 characters recommended
- Examples:
  "Complete Guide to Docker" ‚Üí "complete-guide-to-docker"
  "AWS EKS vs Self-Managed" ‚Üí "aws-eks-vs-self-managed"
```

### 3. Summary Writing
```
- Write 150-200 characters
- Summarize the main value proposition
- Use action words (Learn, Master, Discover)
- Include primary keywords
- End without period
- Examples:
  ‚úÖ "Learn how to leverage Docker containers for efficient application deployment, scaling, and management in modern DevOps workflows"
  ‚ùå "This blog post talks about Docker." (too short)
```

### 4. Category Selection
**MUST use one of these exact categories:**
```
- DevOps
- Kubernetes  
- AWS
- Azure
- Infrastructure
- Data Science
- Security
- Monitoring
```

### 5. Content Structure (Markdown Format)
```markdown
# [Title - H1, only one per post]

Brief introduction paragraph explaining what the reader will learn.

## Section 1 (H2)
Content with explanations, examples, and practical advice.

### Subsection (H3 when needed)
More detailed information.

## Section 2 (H2)
Continue with logical flow.

### Code Examples
Use proper code blocks with language specification:

```bash
# Command examples
kubectl get pods
```

```python
# Python examples
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Best Practices (H2)
- Use bullet points for lists
- **Bold** important terms
- *Italic* for emphasis
- Include practical tips

## Conclusion (H2)
Summarize key takeaways and next steps.
```

### 6. Reading Time Calculation
```javascript
// Formula: (word_count / 200) rounded up
// Average reading speed: 200 words per minute
// Examples:
// 1600 words = 8 minutes
// 1200 words = 6 minutes  
// 800 words = 4 minutes
```

### 7. Tags Array (5-7 tags recommended)
```json
["Docker", "Containerization", "DevOps", "CI/CD", "Kubernetes", "AWS"]
```

**Tag Guidelines:**
- Use proper case (Docker, not docker)
- Include technology names
- Add methodology tags (CI/CD, DevOps, IaC)
- Include cloud providers when relevant
- Add skill level if applicable (Beginner, Advanced)

### 8. Authors Array
```json
["DevOps Expert", "Cloud Architecture Team", "AI Assistant"]
```
